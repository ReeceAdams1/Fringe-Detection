# Fringe Detection

This repository contains resources and notebooks for fringe detection in imaging data, likely related to plasma imaging research at UC Berkeley.

## Contents
- `EvenIllumination.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for processing or analyzing images with even illumination.
- `FringeDetection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook focused on fringe detection algorithms and analysis.
- `binary.png`: Example or output image, possibly showing binary thresholding.
- `Reference.png`, `ReferenceCropped.png`: Reference images used for calibration or comparison.
- `Shot.png`, `ShotCropped.png`: Sample images for analysis, possibly raw and cropped versions.

## Getting Started
1. **Requirements**: Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Dependencies**: Common packages include `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`, and `scipy`. Install them with:
   ```powershell
   pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python scipy
   ```
3. **Usage**:
   - Open the notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in Jupyter.
   - Follow the instructions and code cells to process the provided images.

## Project Purpose
This project aims to detect and analyze fringe patterns in images, which can be useful for optical diagnostics, interferometry, or plasma imaging.
